# Calendar Guide

Set an ICS file path in **Settings → Calendar**.
The parser uses `ical.js` and gracefully falls back to sample events when no file is configured.
The dashboard also includes a **Work Week Meetings** panel (Mon-Fri) with previous/next week navigation and optional Join buttons when event URLs exist.
